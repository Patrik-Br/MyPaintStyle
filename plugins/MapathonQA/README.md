# MapathonQA – JOSM Plugin

Post-mapathon data quality checker for Missing Maps.

## License

GPLv3 — see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). JOSM core is "GPLv2 or later," which makes GPLv3 a compatible
choice for plugins built against it.

## Credits

The non-orthogonal building check (`CheckNonOrthogonalBuildingsAction.java`) ports the
classification logic from **Mapathoner**'s `Helper.that_building()` — same thresholds, same
branch structure — reimplemented here using JOSM's own `Way.getAngles()`. Mapathoner is by
qeef: https://mapathoner.mapathon.cz/

## Build

From within this `MapathonQA/` folder (needs JDK 17+):

1. Download `josm-tested.jar` from https://josm.openstreetmap.de/josm-tested.jar into `lib/` (gitignored, not committed).
2. **Windows:** `build.bat`
   **Linux/Mac:** `./build.sh`

This produces `MapathonQA.jar` in this folder — copy to JOSM's plugins folder and restart JOSM.

## Critical JOSM API notes (learned from bytecode inspection)

- Use `getRawTimestamp()` (returns int, Unix seconds) — NOT `getTimestamp()` (wrong return type in JOSM 19555)
- Use `MainApplication.getLayerManager().getEditDataSet()` — NOT `getActiveDataLayer()`
- Add menu items with `menuRoot.add(new JMenuItem(action))` — NOT `MainMenu.add()`
- `addMenu()` signature: `(name, tooltip, mnemonic, position, helpId)`
- `SimpleDateFormat` MUST use `sdf.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("UTC"))` — all times are UTC
- `Way.getAngles()` (used by the non-orthogonal check) returns corner angles computed from
  projected `EastNorth` coordinates — no manual lat/lon correction needed
- `GeometryUtil`'s ray-casting/segment-intersection checks use raw lat/lon directly (no
  projection correction — fine at the scale of a single building/task)

## Architecture

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MapathonQAPlugin.java` | Entry point, builds menu |
| `RunFullQAAction.java` | Wizard: HOT TM API → task IDs → JOSM search query |
| `RunQAOnCurrentLayerAction.java` | Runs all 7 checks with progress dialog, generates report |
| `GenerateDemoReportAction.java` | Demo report with realistic simulated issue counts across all 7 checks |
| `SetReportFolderAction.java` | Lets the user override where HTML reports are saved (JOSM preference `mapathonqa.reportDir`) |
| `HistoryLogger.java` | Appends one row per real QA run to a persistent `MapathonQA_history.csv` for tracking quality trends over time |
| `CheckNonYesBuildingTagsAction.java` | Check 1: building ≠ yes |
| `CheckOverlappingBuildingsAction.java` | Check 2: overlapping/contained buildings, including exact-duplicate ways (`GeometryUtil.isExactDuplicate`) |
| `CheckBuildingsOnHighwaysAction.java` | Check 3: buildings crossing roads |
| `CheckNonOrthogonalBuildingsAction.java` | Check 4: non-square corners (ported from Mapathoner's `Helper.that_building()`, see Credits) |
| `CheckBuildingLayerTagAction.java` | Check 5: buildings with layer=* tag |
| `CheckBuildingsWithSharedNodesAction.java` | Check 6: shared nodes between buildings and other objects |
| `CheckUntaggedWaysAction.java` | Check 7: untagged objects — ways, plus standalone untagged nodes not used as a way vertex (multipolygon members excluded) |
| `GeometryUtil.java` | Ray-casting, segment intersection, time filter |
| `QAResults.java` | Data container for all check results |
| `ReportWriter.java` | Generates branded HTML report (MM logo embedded as base64 SVG) |

## Time filtering

All checks accept `(DataSet ds, Date since, Date until)`. Objects are only flagged if
`getRawTimestamp() >= since && getRawTimestamp() <= until`. Objects with timestamp=0
(unknown) are always included. The since/until dates are stored in `MapathonQAPlugin.lastStart`
/ `lastEnd` (strings) and parsed as UTC in `RunQAOnCurrentLayerAction.parseStartTime()`.

## HOT TM API

```
GET https://tasking-manager-production-api.hotosm.org/api/v2/projects/{ID}/activities/latest/
```

Returns latest action per task. Plugin filters by `actionDate` within the time window.
All taskStatus values included (MAPPED, VALIDATED, INVALIDATED, BADIMAGERY, READY).
Task grid loaded via OpenLocationAction reflection (tries 3 method signatures for compat).

## Report

`ReportWriter.write(QAResults)` generates a self-contained HTML file with:
- Missing Maps logo embedded as base64 SVG (passed as constant string `LOGO_URI`)
- White header with MM logo + red bottom border
- Meta strip, two summary cards, issues table, recommendations
- Saved to the folder configured via **MapathonQA → Set Report Save Folder...** (JOSM preference
  `mapathonqa.reportDir`); if unset or invalid, falls back to ~/Downloads/, then Desktop, then home
- Overlapping-buildings row note gets a trailing "N building(s) were duplicated." clause appended
  only when `QAResults.overlappingBuildings.duplicateBuildingCount > 0` — no separate report row
  or column for duplicates, they're folded into the existing overlap count/selection

`ReportWriter.writeDemoReport(QAResults)` wraps `write()` and injects a blue demo banner.

## History log

`HistoryLogger.appendRow(QAResults)` appends one CSV row per real `Run QA on Current Layer`
execution to `MapathonQA_history.csv`, in the same folder as HTML reports. The file is created
with a header + UTF-8 BOM (so Excel renders it correctly) on first use, then only ever appended
to — never overwritten — so a series of mapathons accumulates in one file that can be opened
in Excel/Sheets to chart quality score, issue counts, etc. over time. Only wired into
`RunQAOnCurrentLayerAction`, deliberately **not** called from `GenerateDemoReportAction` — demo
runs use fake data and must not pollute the real history.
